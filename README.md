Module 5 Challenge

## Overview
Pymaceuticals, Inc. is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. I was given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. I was tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. I was also asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Analysis
Capomulin was tested against 8 other tumor treatment regimens as well as a placebo group. The tumor volume of mice that were tested with Capomulin seemed significantly lower than 7 of the other treatments, and the placebo. The only other drug that closely compared to Capumulin in reducing tumor size was Ramicane. These results may have been impacted by the number of mice treated with both Capomulin and Ramicane, as those two drugs were used to test 230 and 228 mice, respectively, where as the other treatments were used on between 148 and 188 mice. More testing will need to occur with a larger population of mice in order to confirm the results, but at this time treatment using Capomulin appears promising.
